  `CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt online to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to exfiltrate data. In these challenges, the participant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that is hidden, called the "flag", hence the name for this type of competition.
   Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. This site focuses on events that target the high school and college student range, with some offering prizes those that place highly in the competition! Many challenges do not require programming knowledge and are simply a matter of problem solving and creative thinking.
   CTFs are the most common kind of cybersecurity competition. They revolve around a set of challenges that are designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or "flag" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to the competition scoring engine to earn points and progress forward. Competitors aim is to solve as many challenges as possible in the competition time frame.
   Attack & Defense are a less common kind of competition with more moving parts. In A&D, teams setup & audit vulnerable machines. At the start of the competition, teams connect to an isolated network. Within this network, participants, or an organized "red team", will launch attacks against the defending participants' machines. Teams receive points for properly defending their machines and keeping their machines operating normally.`
