  `CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that is hidden. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!
   Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. This site focuses on events that target the high school and college student range, with some offering monetary support for education to those that place highly in the competition! Many challenges do not require programming knowledge and are simply a matter of problem solving and creative thinking.
   Jeopardy CTFs are the most common kind of CTF. They revolve around a set of challenges that are designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or "flag" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to a website or scoring engine in exchange for points. Competitors usually receive about 72 hours (typically the course of a weekend) to solve as many challenges as possible.
   Attack & Defense are a less common kind of competition with more moving parts. In A&D, teams setup & audit vulnerable server software. At the start of the competition, teams connect to an isolated network. Within this network, teams will launch attacks against each others servers hoping to exploit the vulnerabilities they've found. Teams receive points for extracting flags, properly defending their flags, and keeping their servers operating normally.`
