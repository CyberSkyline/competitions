    longDescription: (`
      In 2011, a group of cybersecurity-focused academics from several public agencies got together and created an innovative way for students to apply what they were learning in class. It would be important to reduce barriers and excite young people to participate. Students would have easy access, no matter what their age, skill level or location. The NCL Competition was born. It was one of the earliest e-sports - a competitive game-meets-edutainment - and it would simulate real-life cyberthreats in a safe environment, for students to learn how to defend organizations against cyber-threats and keep them secure


      NCL offers a fun way to learn and apply your skills in a safe environment - but it’s so much more than that, because with their NCL Scouting Reports you can present credible proof to employers of your hands-on expertise.

      The NCL challenges are based on nine critical cybersecurity workforce categories: Open Source Intelligence, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Network Traffic, Forensics, Web App Exploitation, Scanning, and Enumeration & Exploitation.

      The NCL competition is open to anyone enrolled in at least one course in high school or a collegiate institution. Players are expected to commit to the entire Season. The registration fee is just $35 per individual to participate in the Preseason, Individual Game, and Team Game. Included in the fee is the virtual NCL Gymnasium and a wealth of resources to boost players’ knowledge along the way.

    longDescription: (`
      Panoply, a Network Security Competition, is a network assessment and network defense competition combined into a single event. Teams of students compete for control of common resources and the critical services on those resources. Once a team takes possession of a resource, they must secure that resource against attacks from other teams and maintain the critical services running on the resource. Teams accumulate points for controlling and operating critical services such as SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and so on.


      Panoply is a timed competition event. At the beginning of the competition, common resources are available for teams to scan, assess, and penetrate. To claim ownership of a service, teams must plant their flag, an assigned hexadecimal string, inside the banner of the service. An automated scanner detects ownership changes and awards ownership of the service to the team whose flag appears in the service banner. At random intervals, an automated scoring engine checks the status and functionality of all critical services. If a team has ownership of a functional critical service during a successful service check, that team is awarded points for owning and maintaining a critical service. Teams accumulate points for each critical service they control and continue to accumulate points as long as they own and maintain those critical services. Teams that fail to secure resources and services they have captured may have them taken away by rival teams. Throughout the competition new resources are added to the common pool, forcing teams to choose between defending existing assets and going after new assets. The team with the highest point total at the end of the competition wins.

      HSCTF ("High School Capture the Flag") is the first CTF designed by high schoolers for high schoolers. Unlike other CTFs, HSCTF isn't purely about computer security. It extends the CTF model of competition to other areas of computer science such as the design and analysis of algorithms and programming languages. Each challenge will still have a flag, and most of our challenges will fall into the traditional CTF categories of cryptography, reverse engineering, programming languages, forensics, and recon.Our primary goals are to educate students in computer science, and to increase their interest in computer science.


      The competition is open to middle school and high school (6th to 12th grade) students from the United States. Teams can be composed of 5 or fewer students. There will be a non-competitive division for all participating teams who are disqualified by the above rules.

      Challenges will vary widely in difficulty. We expect some challenges to be solved by every team, and others to be solved by only a few teams or even none. Teams should be potentially capable of performing very well in this competition with no CTF experience. We hope HSCTF will be a fun, educational experience for all competitors.

      MITRE's eCTF (embedded capture-the-flag) is an embedded security competition that puts participants through the experience of trying to create a secure system and then learning from their mistakes. The main target is a real physical (or emulated for 2021) embedded device, which opens the scope of the challenge to include physical/proximal access attacks. The eCTF is a two-phase competition with attack and defense components. In the first phase, competitors design and implement a secure system based on a set of challenge requirements. The second phase involves analyzing and attacking the other teams’ designs.


      The eCTF is unique in two major ways. First, the focus is on securing embedded systems, which present an entirely new set of challenges and security issues that are not currently covered by traditional “online” CTFs. Second, this event balances offense and defense by including a significant secure-design phase in addition to an attack phase. This competition will help you develop practical skills that can be applied securing critical systems, such as medical devices, smart grids, IoT devices, and mobile devices.

      This year teams will design a secure communications system for a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) package delivery system. The system must be secure to prevent attackers from gaining access to the network to spy on and disrupt the UAV system.

      Students at all academic levels are welcome to participate. Team sizes are unlimited (although a minimum of 4 students is recommended). Sponsorship of a faculty member is preferred.

      At its heart, CPTC is a bit different from several other collegiate Cybersecurity competitions. Instead of defending your network, searching for flags, or claiming ownership of systems, CPTC focuses on mimicking the activities performed during a real-world penetration testing engagement conducted by companies, professional services firms, and internal security departments around the world.


      The Global Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) started small, in a classroom at RIT. Bill Stackpole, a professor of Defensive and Offensive Security, saw a gap between book learning and the real world that he wanted to close in order to set his students up for success after graduation. He started building a competition. Taking this classroom competition, he enlisted the help of many dedicated volunteers, spanning industry professionals, academics, and sponsors who worked tirelessly to give that same experience to all students interested in the computing security field.

      To give an idea of the level of this competition; during both the 2020-2021 and the 2019-2020 competition cycles, some teams had more than 100 students attend tryouts. During the Global Finals, competitors discovered zero-days in commercial technologies, registered them as CVEs, and designed a patch for the most critical vulnerability. Many students get co-op and career job offers as a direct result of the Sponsor Faire.

      The 2021-22 competition theme is Industrial Food Manufacturing and Sales for Le Bon Bon Croissant, a fictitious global bakery & confectionary who operates their own retail stores. We announced this at the Global Finals of 2021 so students can build expertise in manufacturing and retail technologies.

      The NSA Codebreaker Challenge provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering / low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission.


      Reverse engineering is a crucial skill for those involved in the fight against malware, advanced persistent threats, and similar malicious cyber activities. As the organization tasked with protecting U.S. government national security information systems, NSA is looking to develop these skills in university students and prospective future employees. NSA isn’t the only organization interested in these skills - many Fortune 500 companies are also looking for individuals with reverse engineering abilities, as they work to protect their corporate computer systems and networks. In addition, the same techniques used to reverse engineer an unknown binary can often be applied to diagnose and fix bugs in your own applications, especially if they are low-level / hard to find. It is important to note that reverse engineering might violate the End User License Agreement of some software packages and/or be considered illegal in certain cases. Always check with the appropriate copyright holder / legal counsel if unsure.

      While the challenge is intended for students, professors are encouraged to participate as well. Furthermore, the site was designed to make it easy for those professors interested in incorporating the challenge into their courses to do so (see the additional FAQ entries below.)
