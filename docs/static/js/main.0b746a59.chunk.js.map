got together and created an innovative way for students to apply what they were learning in class. It would be important to reduce barriers and excite young people to participate. Students would have easy access, no matter what their age, skill level or location. The NCL Competition was born. It was one of the earliest e-sports - a competitive game-meets-edutainment - and it would simulate real-life cyberthreats in a safe environment, for students to learn how to defend organizations against cyber-threats and keep them secure\n\n\n      NCL offers a fun way to learn and apply your skills in a safe environment - but it’s so much more than that, because with their NCL Scouting Reports you can present credible proof to employers of your hands-on expertise.\n\n      The NCL challenges are based on nine critical cybersecurity workforce categories: Open Source Intelligence, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Network Traffic, Forensics, Web App Exploitation, Scanning, and Enumeration & Exploitation.\n\n      The NCL competition is open to anyone enrolled in at least one course in high school or a collegiate institution. Players are expected to commit to the entire Season. The registration fee is just $35 per individual to participate in the Preseason, Individual Game, and Team Game.

Top teams advance through the online round of competition, and the best of the best advance to the in-person National Finals Competition.\n\n      Each team has two challenges during their six-hour competition period. The Network Security Challenge involves finding and fixing security vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux operating systems. The Cisco Networking Challenge consists of an online quiz and a virtual networking exercise based on specific training materials.\n\n      CyberPatriot is designed for any student, regardless of prior cybersecurity knowledge. Training materials are available through the volunteer dashboard and through Cisco Networking Academy.

Teams of students compete for control of common resources and the critical services on those resources. Once a team takes possession of a resource, they must secure that resource against attacks from other teams and maintain the critical services running on the resource. Teams accumulate points for controlling and operating critical services such as SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and so on.\n\n\n      Panoply is a timed competition event. At the beginning of the competition, common resources are available for teams to scan, assess, and penetrate. To claim ownership of a service, teams must plant their flag, an assigned hexadecimal string, inside the banner of the service. An automated scanner detects ownership changes and awards ownership of the service to the team whose flag appears in the service banner. At random intervals, an automated scoring engine checks the status and functionality of all critical services. If a team has ownership of a functional critical service during a successful service check, that team is awarded points for owning and maintaining a critical service. Teams accumulate points for each critical service they control and continue to accumulate points as long as they own and maintain those critical services. Teams that fail to secure resources and services they have captured may have them taken away by rival teams. Throughout the competition new resources are added to the common pool, forcing teams to choose between defending existing assets and going after new assets. The team with the highest point total at the end of the competition wins.\n    `),\n    logoURL: '/images/Panoply.jpg',\n    regURL: 'http://cyberpanoply.com/event.html',\n    contactInfo: 'mailto:kevin.archer@utsa.edu',\n  },\n  {\n    header: 'CSAW CTF',\n    description: 'CSAW [see-SAH] is the most comprehensive student-run cyber security event in the world, featuring 10 hacking competitions, workshops, and industry events.',\n    startDate: new Date('2021-09-10'),\n    endDate: new Date('2021-09-12'),\n    longDescription: (`\n      The CSAW games, founded by Professor Nasir Memon as a small contest called Cyber Security Awareness Week, have grown to become the most comprehensive set of cybersecurity challenges by and for students around the globe.\n\n\n      CSAW CTF is one of the oldest and biggest CTFs with 1216 teams with 1+ points in 2020.

Bill Stackpole, a professor of Defensive and Offensive Security, saw a gap between book learning and the real world that he wanted to close in order to set his students up for success after graduation. He started building a competition. Taking this classroom competition, he enlisted the help of many dedicated volunteers, spanning industry professionals, academics, and sponsors who worked tirelessly to give that same experience to all students interested in the computing security field.\n\n      To give an idea of the level of this competition; during both the 2020-2021 and the 2019-2020 competition cycles, some teams had more than 100 students attend tryouts. During the Global Finals, competitors discovered zero-days in commercial technologies, registered them as CVEs, and designed a patch for the most critical vulnerability. Many students get co-op and career job offers as a direct result of the Sponsor Faire.\n\n      The 2021-22 competition theme is Industrial Food Manufacturing and Sales for Le Bon Bon Croissant, a fictitious global bakery & confectionary who operates their own retail stores. We announced this at the Global Finals of 2021 so students can build expertise in manufacturing and retail technologies.\n    `),\n    logoURL: '/images/CPC.png',\n    regURL: 'https://globalcptc.org/',\n    contactInfo: 'https://globalcptc.org/contact',\n  },\n  {\n    header: 'NSA Codebreaker',\n    description: 'The NSA Codebreaker Challenge provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering / low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA\\'s mission.',\n    startDate: new Date('2021-08-01'),\n    endDate: new Date('2021-08-01'),\n    longDescription: (`\n      The NSA Codebreaker Challenge provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering / low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission.\n\n\n      Reverse engineering is a crucial skill for those involved in the fight against malware, advanced persistent threats, and similar malicious cyber activities. As the organization tasked with protecting U.S. government national security information systems, NSA is looking to develop these skills in university students and prospective future employees. NSA isn’t the only organization interested in these skills - many Fortune 500 companies are also looking for individuals with reverse engineering abilities, as they work to protect their corporate computer systems and networks. In addition, the same techniques used to reverse engineer an unknown binary can often be applied to diagnose and fix bugs in your own applications, especially if they are low-level / hard to find. It is important to note that reverse engineering might violate the End User License Agreement of some software packages and/or be considered illegal in certain cases. Always check with the appropriate copyright holder / legal counsel if unsure.\n\n      While the challenge is intended for students, professors are encouraged to participate as well.

In these challenges, the participant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that is hidden, called the \"flag\", hence the name for this type of competition.\n   Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. This site focuses on events that target the high school and college student range, with some offering prizes those that place highly in the competition! Many challenges do not require programming knowledge and are simply a matter of problem solving and creative thinking.\n   CTFs are the most common kind of cybersecurity competition. They revolve around a set of challenges that are designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or \"flag\" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to the competition scoring engine to earn points and progress forward. Competitors aim is to solve as many challenges as possible in the competition time frame.\n   Attack & Defense are a less common kind of competition with more moving parts. In A&D, teams setup & audit vulnerable machines. At the start of the competition, teams connect to an isolated network. Within this network, participants, or an organized \"red team\", will launch attacks against the defending participants' machines. Teams receive points for properly defending their machines and keeping their machines operating normally.`\n);\n","/* eslint-disable no-else-return */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Message, Grid, Header } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport { INTRO_MESSAGE, NICE_URL } from './constants.js';\n\nfunction AboutCompetitions() {\n  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(true);\n\n  if (visible) {\n    return (\n      <Message textAlign='center' visible='true' onDismiss={() => setVisible(false)}>\n        <Header size='huge' textAlign='center' color='red' style={{ margin: '.5em' }}>What are Cybersecurity Competitions?</Header>\n        <Grid stackable doubling columns={4} divided>\n          <Grid.Row>\n            {_.chain(INTRO_MESSAGE).split('\\n').map((line) => (\n              <Grid.Column textAlign='justified' as='b' dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: line }} />\n            )).value()}\n          </Grid.Row>\n          <Grid.Row centered>\n            <a href={NICE_URL} target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n              Learn more about from the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)\n            </a>\n          </Grid.Row>\n        </Grid>\n      </Message>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AboutCompetitions;\n","/* eslint-disable react/no-danger */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport marked from 'marked';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Button, Header, Image, Modal, Grid, Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\nmarked.setOptions({\n  gfm: true,\n});\n\nfunction Modalpopup(props) {\n  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);\n  const { header, logoURL, longDescription, contactInfo, regURL } = props;\n  const input = _.chain(longDescription).split('\\n').map(_.trimStart).join('\\n').value();\n\n  const html = marked(input);\n\n  return (\n    <Modal\n      closeIcon\n      onClose={() => setOpen(false)}\n      onOpen={() => setOpen(true)}\n      open={open}\n      trigger={props.trigger}\n    >\n      <Modal.Header>\n        <Grid textAlign='left' columns={2}>\n          <Grid.Column>\n            <Header as='h1' content={header} />\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </Modal.Header>\n      <Modal.Content image>\n        <Image size='small' src={logoURL} style={{ marginLeft: '1em', marginRight: '1em' }} />\n        <Modal.Description>\n          {props.endDate !== null ?
