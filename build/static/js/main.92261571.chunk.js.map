Players are expected to commit to the entire Season. The registration fee is just $35 per individual to participate in the Preseason, Individual Game, and Team Game.

Teams of students compete for control of common resources and the critical services on those resources. Once a team takes possession of a resource, they must secure that resource against attacks from other teams and maintain the critical services running on the resource. Teams accumulate points for controlling and operating critical services such as SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and so on.\n      \n      \n      Panoply is a timed competition event. At the beginning of the competition, common resources are available for teams to scan, assess, and penetrate. To claim ownership of a service, teams must plant their flag, an assigned hexadecimal string, inside the banner of the service. An automated scanner detects ownership changes and awards ownership of the service to the team whose flag appears in the service banner. At random intervals, an automated scoring engine checks the status and functionality of all critical services. If a team has ownership of a functional critical service during a successful service check, that team is awarded points for owning and maintaining a critical service. Teams accumulate points for each critical service they control and continue to accumulate points as long as they own and maintain those critical services. Teams that fail to secure resources and services they have captured may have them taken away by rival teams. Throughout the competition new resources are added to the common pool, forcing teams to choose between defending existing assets and going after new assets. The team with the highest point total at the end of the competition wins.\n    `),\n    logoURL: '/images/Panoply.jpg',\n    regURL: 'http://cyberpanoply.com/event.html',\n    contactInfo: 'mailto:kevin.archer@utsa.edu',\n  },\n  {\n    header: 'CSAW CTF',\n    description: 'CSAW [see-SAH] is the most comprehensive student-run cyber security event in the world, featuring 10 hacking competitions, workshops, and industry events.',\n    startDate: new Date('2021-09-10'),\n    endDate: new Date('2021-09-12'),\n    longDescription: (`\n      The CSAW games, founded by Professor Nasir Memon as a small contest called Cyber Security Awareness Week, have grown to become the most comprehensive set of cybersecurity challenges by and for students around the globe.\n      \n      \n      CSAW CTF is one of the oldest and biggest CTFs with 1216 teams with 1+ points in 2020.

The main target is a real physical (or emulated for 2021) embedded device, which opens the scope of the challenge to include physical/proximal access attacks. The eCTF is a two-phase competition with attack and defense components. In the first phase, competitors design and implement a secure system based on a set of challenge requirements. The second phase involves analyzing and attacking the other teams’ designs.\n      \n      \n      The eCTF is unique in two major ways. First, the focus is on securing embedded systems, which present an entirely new set of challenges and security issues that are not currently covered by traditional “online” CTFs. Second, this event balances offense and defense by including a significant secure-design phase in addition to an attack phase. This competition will help you develop practical skills that can be applied securing critical systems, such as medical devices, smart grids, IoT devices, and mobile devices.\n      \n      This year teams will design a secure communications system for a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) package delivery system. The system must be secure to prevent attackers from gaining access to the network to spy on and disrupt the UAV system.\n      \n      Students at all academic levels are welcome to participate.

Many challenges do not require programming knowledge and are simply a matter of problem solving and creative thinking.\n   Jeopardy CTFs are the most common kind of CTF. They revolve around a set of challenges that are designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or \"flag\" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to a website or scoring engine in exchange for points. Competitors usually receive about 72 hours (typically the course of a weekend) to solve as many challenges as possible.\n   Attack & Defense are a less common kind of competition with more moving parts. In A&D, teams setup & audit vulnerable server software. At the start of the competition, teams connect to an isolated network. Within this network, teams will launch attacks against each others servers hoping to exploit the vulnerabilities they've found. Teams receive points for extracting flags, properly defending their flags, and keeping their servers operating normally.`\n);\n","/* eslint-disable no-else-return */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport marked from 'marked';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Message, Grid, Header } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport { introMessage } from './constants.js';\n\nmarked.setOptions({\n  gfm: true,\n});\n\nfunction DismissibleMessage() {\n  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(true);\n\n  if (visible) {\n    return (\n      <Message textAlign='center' visible='true' onDismiss={() => setVisible(false)}>\n        <Message.Header>\n          <Header size='medium' textAlign='center' color='red' style={{ margin: '.5em' }}>What are Cybersecurity Competitions?</Header>\n        </Message.Header>\n        <Grid stackable doubling columns={4} divided>\n          <Grid.Row>\n            {_.chain(introMessage).split('\\n').map((line) => (\n              <Grid.Column textAlign='justified' as='b' dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: line }} />\n            )).value()}\n          </Grid.Row>\n        </Grid>\n      </Message>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DismissibleMessage;\n","/* eslint-disable react/no-danger */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport marked from 'marked';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Button, Header, Image, Modal, Grid, Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\nmarked.setOptions({\n  gfm: true,\n});\n\nfunction Modalpopup(props) {\n  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);\n  const { header, logoURL, longDescription, contactInfo, regURL } = props;\n  const input = _.chain(longDescription).split('\\n').map(_.trimStart).join('\\n')\n    .value();\n  const html = marked(input);\n  return (\n    <Modal\n      closeIcon\n      onClose={() => setOpen(false)}\n      onOpen={() => setOpen(true)}\n      open={open}\n      trigger={props.trigger}\n    >\n      <Modal.Header>\n        <Grid textAlign='left' columns={2}>\n          <Grid.Column>\n            <Header content={header} size='huge' />\n            {props.endDate !== null ?
