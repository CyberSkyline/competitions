This goal is called the flag, hence the name!\n   Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. This site focuses on events that target the high school and college student range, with some offering monetary support for education to those that place highly in the competition! Many challenges do not require programming knowledge and are simply a matter of problem solving and creative thinking.\n   Jeopardy CTFs are the most common kind of CTF. They revolve around a set of challenges that are designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or "flag" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to a website or scoring engine in exchange for points. Competitors usually receive about 72 hours (typically the course of a weekend) to solve as many challenges as possible.\n   Attack & Defense are a less common kind of competition with more moving parts. In A&D, teams setup & audit vulnerable server software. At the start of the competition, teams connect to an isolated network. Within this network, teams will launch attacks against each others servers hoping to exploit the vulnerabilities they\'ve found. Teams receive points for extracting flags, properly defending their flags, and keeping their servers operating normally.').split("\n").map((function(e){return Object(v.jsx)(u.a.Column,{textAlign:"justified",as:"b",dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:e}})})).value()})})]}):null},k=n(52),j=n(135),T=n(137),x=n(5),D=n.n(x),S=n(87),F=n.n(S),O=n(133),A=n(131);F.a.setOptions({gfm:!0});var U=function(e){var t=o.a.useState(!1),n=Object(m.a)(t,2),a=n[0],i=n[1],s=e.header,r=e.logoURL,l=e.longDescription,d=e.contactInfo,p=e.regURL,y=f.a.chain(l).split("\n").map(f.a.trimStart).join("\n").value(),b=F()(y);return Object(v.jsxs)(O.a,{closeIcon:!0,onClose:function(){return i(!1)},onOpen:function(){return i(!0)},open:a,trigger:e.trigger,children:[Object(v.jsx)(O.a.Header,{children:Object(v.jsx)(u.a,{textAlign:"left",columns:2,children:Object(v.jsxs)(u.a.Column,{children:[Object(v.jsx)(h.a,{content:s,size:"huge"}),null!==e.endDate?Object(v.jsx)(h.a,{size:"tiny",content:"".concat(c()(e.startDate).utc().format("MMMM D")," - ").concat(c()(e.endDate).utc().format("MMMM D, YYYY"))}):null]})})}),Object(v.jsxs)(O.a.Content,{image:!0,children:[Object(v.jsx)(g.a,{size:"small",src:r}),Object(v.jsx)(O.a.Description,{style:{margin:"1em"},dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:b}})]}),Object(v.jsx)(O.a.Actions,{children:Object(v.jsxs)(u.a,{columns:2,verticalAlign:"middle",children:[Object(v.jsx)(u.a.Column,{children:Object(v.jsx)(A.a,{textAlign:"left",children:"Disclaimer: Links on this site are not hosted by CTF Info"})}),Object(v.jsxs)(u.a.Column,{children:[Object(v.jsx)(T.a,{as:"a",color:"blue",href:d,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:"Contact"}),Object(v.jsx)(T.a,{as:"a",color:"red",href:p,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:"Registration"})]})]})})]})};D.a.string,D.a.instanceOf;var L=function(e){var t=e.header,n=e.logoURL,a=e.startDate,o=e.endDate;return Object(v.jsxs)(j.a,{raised:!0,children:[Object(v.jsx)(u.a,{verticalAlign:"middle",textAlign:"center",style:{height:250},children:Object(v.jsx)(u.a.Column,{children:Object(v.jsx)(g.a,{size:"small",src:n,wrapped:!0})})}),Object(v.jsxs)(j.a.Content,{children:[Object(v.jsx)(j.a.Header,{children:t}),Object(v.jsx)(j.a.Meta,{children:null!==o?Object(v.jsx)(h.a,{size:"tiny",sub:!0,content:"".concat(c()(a).utc().format("MMMM D")," - ").concat(c()(o).utc().format("MMMM D, YYYY"))}):Object(v.jsx)(h.a,{size:"tiny",sub:!0,content:"Check back for Updates"})}),Object(v.jsxs)(u.a.Row,{children:[Object(v.jsx)(d.a,{hidden:!0,fitted:!0,style:{height:8}}),Object(v.jsx)(j.a.Description,{className:"two-line-truncate",children:e.description})]})]}),Object(v.jsx)(j.a.Content,{children:Object(v.jsx)(u.a.Row,{textAlign:"center",children:Object(v.jsx)(U,Object(k.a)({trigger:Object(v.jsx)(T.a,{fluid:!0,children:"More Information"})},e))})})]})},I=[{header:"National Cyber League",description:"The National Cyber League (NCL) is the most inclusive, performance-based, learning-centered collegiate cybersecurity competition today!",startDate:new Date("2021-08-23"),endDate:new Date("2021-12-17"),longDescription:"\n      In 2011, a group of cybersecurity-focused academics from several public agencies got together and created an innovative way for students to apply what they were learning in class.

Teams of students compete for control of common resources and the critical services on those resources.

Teams accumulate points for controlling and operating critical services such as SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and so on.\n      \n      \n      Panoply is a timed competition event. At the beginning of the competition, common resources are available for teams to scan, assess, and penetrate. To claim ownership of a service, teams must plant their flag, an assigned hexadecimal string, inside the banner of the service. An automated scanner detects ownership changes and awards ownership of the service to the team whose flag appears in the service banner. At random intervals, an automated scoring engine checks the status and functionality of all critical services. If a team has ownership of a functional critical service during a successful service check, that team is awarded points for owning and maintaining a critical service. Teams accumulate points for each critical service they control and continue to accumulate points as long as they own and maintain those critical services. Teams that fail to secure resources and services they have captured may have them taken away by rival teams. Throughout the competition new resources are added to the common pool, forcing teams to choose between defending existing assets and going after new assets.
