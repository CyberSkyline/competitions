competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that is hidden. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!\n   Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. This site focuses on events that target the high school and college student range, with some offering monetary support for education to those that place highly in the competition! Many challenges do not require programming knowledge and are simply a matter of problem solving and creative thinking.\n   Jeopardy CTFs are the most common kind of CTF. They revolve around a set of challenges that are designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or \"flag\" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to a website or scoring engine in exchange for points. Competitors usually receive about 72 hours (typically the course of a weekend) to solve as many challenges as possible.\n   Attack & Defense are a less common kind of competition with more moving parts. In A&D, teams setup & audit vulnerable server software. At the start of the competition, teams connect to an isolated network. Within this network, teams will launch attacks against each others servers hoping to exploit the vulnerabilities they've found. Teams receive points for extracting flags, properly defending their flags, and keeping their servers operating normally.`\n);\n","/* eslint-disable no-else-return */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Message, Grid, Header } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport { introMessage } from './constants.js';\n\nfunction DismissibleMessage() {\n  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(true);\n\n  if (visible) {\n    return (\n      <Message textAlign='center' visible='true' onDismiss={() => setVisible(false)}>\n        <Header size='huge' textAlign='center' color='red' style={{ margin: '.5em' }}>What are Cybersecurity Competitions?</Header>\n        <Grid stackable doubling columns={4} divided>\n          <Grid.Row>\n            {_.chain(introMessage).split('\\n').map((line) => (\n              <Grid.Column textAlign='justified' as='b' dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: line }} />\n            )).value()}\n          </Grid.Row>\n        </Grid>\n      </Message>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DismissibleMessage;\n","/* eslint-disable newline-per-chained-call */\n/* eslint-disable react/no-danger */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport marked from 'marked';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Button, Header, Image, Modal, Grid, Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\nmarked.setOptions({\n  gfm: true,\n});\n\nfunction ModalPopup(props) {\n  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);\n  const { header, logoURL, longDescription, contactInfo, regURL } = props;\n  const input = _.chain(longDescription).split('\\n').map(_.trimStart).join('\\n').value();\n  const html = marked(input);\n  return (\n    <Modal\n      closeIcon\n      onClose={() => setOpen(false)}\n      onOpen={() => setOpen(true)}\n      open={open}\n      trigger={props.trigger}\n    >\n      <Modal.Header>\n        <Grid textAlign='left' columns={2}>\n          <Grid.Column>\n            <Header content={header} size='huge' />\n            {props.endDate !== null ?

Teams of students compete for control of common resources and the critical services on those resources. Once a team takes possession of a resource, they must secure that resource against attacks from other teams and maintain the critical services running on the resource. Teams accumulate points for controlling and operating critical services such as SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and so on.\n      \n      \n      Panoply is a timed competition event. At the beginning of the competition, common resources are available for teams to scan, assess, and penetrate. To claim ownership of a service, teams must plant their flag, an assigned hexadecimal string, inside the banner of the service. An automated scanner detects ownership changes and awards ownership of the service to the team whose flag appears in the service banner. At random intervals, an automated scoring engine checks the status and functionality of all critical services. If a team has ownership of a functional critical service during a successful service check, that team is awarded points for owning and maintaining a critical service. Teams accumulate points for each critical service they control and continue to accumulate points as long as they own and maintain those critical services. Teams that fail to secure resources and services they have captured may have them taken away by rival teams. Throughout the competition new resources are added to the common pool, forcing teams to choose between defending existing assets and going after new assets. The team with the highest point total at the end of the competition wins.\n    `),\n    logoURL: '/images/Panoply.jpg',\n    regURL: 'http://cyberpanoply.com/event.html',\n    contactInfo: 'mailto:kevin.archer@utsa.edu',\n  },\n  {\n    header: 'CSAW CTF',\n    description: 'CSAW [see-SAH] is the most comprehensive student-run cyber security event in the world, featuring 10 hacking competitions, workshops, and industry events.',\n    startDate: new Date('2021-09-10'),\n    endDate: new Date('2021-09-12'),\n    longDescription: (`\n      The CSAW games, founded by Professor Nasir Memon as a small contest called Cyber Security Awareness Week, have grown to become the most comprehensive set of cybersecurity challenges by and for students around the globe.\n      \n      \n      CSAW CTF is one of the oldest and biggest CTFs with 1216 teams with 1+ points in 2020.

Ineligible players will still be able to view challenges, submit flags, and see how they rank compared to other teams.\n    `),\n    logoURL: '/images/angstromCTF.png',\n    regURL: 'https://angstromctf.com/',\n    contactInfo: 'mailto:angstromctf@protonmail.com,',\n  },\n];\n","/* eslint-disable newline-per-chained-call */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Card } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport CustomCard from './CustomCard';\nimport competitions from './competitionData';\n\nfunction CurrentEvents() {\n  return (\n    <Card.Group stackable itemsPerRow={4} doubling centered padded='vertically'>\n      {_.chain(competitions).sortBy('startDate').filter((element) => (element.endDate > new Date() || element.endDate === null)).map((element) => (<CustomCard key={element.header} {...element} />)).value()}\n    </Card.Group>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default CurrentEvents;\n","/* eslint-disable newline-per-chained-call */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport _ from 'lodash';\nimport { Card } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport CustomCard from './CustomCard';\nimport competitions from './competitionData';\n\nfunction PastEvents() {\n  return (\n    <Card.Group stackable itemsPerRow={4} doubling centered padded='vertically'>\n      {_.chain(competitions).orderBy((competition) => new Date(competition.startDate), 'desc').filter((element) => (element.endDate !== null && element.endDate <= new Date())).map((element) => (<CustomCard key={element.header} {...element} />)).value()}\n    </Card.Group>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default PastEvents;\n","/* eslint-disable max-len */\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport { Segment, Grid, Divider, Header, Image, List } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport './themes/style.css';\nimport DismissibleMessage from './DismissibleMessage';\nimport * as constants from './constants';\nimport CurrentEvents from './CurrentEvents';\nimport PastEvents from './PastEvents';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <Segment textAlign='center'>\n      <Header size='huge'>\n        <i className='fas fa-laptop-code' style={{ 'margin-right': '.5em' }} />\n        Cyber Competitions Info\n      </Header>\n    </Segment>\n\n    <div style={{ maxWidth: 1425, margin: 'auto', padding: '2em' }}>\n      <DismissibleMessage />\n\n      <Divider horizontal section style={{ padding: '1em' }}>\n        <Header size='large'>\n          Current Events\n        </Header>\n      </Divider>\n\n      <CurrentEvents />\n\n      <Divider horizontal section style={{ padding: '1em' }}>\n        <Header size='large'>\n          Past Events\n        </Header>\n      </Divider>\n\n      <PastEvents />\n    </div>\n\n    <Segment className='Footer'>\n      <Grid centered verticalAlign='middle'>\n        <Grid.Column floated='left' mobile={5} tablet={3} computer={2} largeScreen={2} widescreen={2}>\n          <a href='https://cyberskyline.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n            <Image src='/images/cyberskyline.svg' />\n          </a>\n        </Grid.Column>\n        <Grid.Column mobile={11} tablet={12} computer={12} largeScreen={12} widescreen={12}>\n          <List horizontal centered divided floated='right'>\n            <List.Item>\n              <a href='https://github.com/CyberSkyline/competitions/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Want to add your CTF</a>\n            </List.Item>\n            <List.Item>\n              <span>{`Cyber Skyline ©  ${moment(new Date()).utc().format('YYYY')}`}</span>\n            </List.Item>\n            <List.Item>\n              {`Last updated: ${moment(constants.lastUpdated).utc().format('MMMM D, YYYY')}`}\n            </List.Item>\n          </List>\n        </Grid.Column>\n      </Grid>\n    </Segment>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
